# ZostiNicheEvol
Studying the evolution of bioclimatic niches in white-eyes (Aves: *Zosterops*).  

A collection of R code used for the analyses in the following manuscript:

Engler JO, Lawrie Y, Cabral JS & Lens L (submitted): Niche evolution reveals disparate signatures of speciation in the 'great speciator' (white-eyes, Aves: *Zosterops*). *J Biogeogr* Manuscript ID JBI-19-0491 

This R code is documented and comes with imput files to reproduce the analyses and basic visuals. 

*Disclaimer* This code was initially not intended for sharing and is not necessarily following best practice guides of coding (please be gentle with the Ornithologist behind the desk while he is improving).
